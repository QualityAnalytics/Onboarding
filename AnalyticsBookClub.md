# Analytics Book Club üìö

The intent of the Analytics Book Club is to provide a collaborative space to learn new analytic, modeling, theory, business principles, and best practices to aid in employee growth and training.

- Environment
  - This is an asynchronous book club. Most of the group's discussions will be posted/documented in a thread in the Quality Analytics Team rather than in a live meeting/discussion.
  - Being asynchronous means that we will communicate concepts in a variety of ways whenever convenient. This means when you have an idea in your head, you can post it right away! Or have some food for thought for the team on a topic you read today? Add it to the chat for people to think about.

- Guidelines
  - Our intent is to foster and grow an inclusive environment
  - The aim is to have productive conversations about topics that can increase our productivity, ease some common blockers, or even just make our day easier. The goal is not to win arguments. The goal is to gain perspective and grasp what is best for the team.
  - As awesome as it is to participiate and voice your opinion and perspective, please remember to value other people's voices and take the time to read and consider their thoughts.
  - Be respectful and approach conversations with humility.
  - Use this reading and discussion time to brush up on good habits like note-taking and engaging in intentional conversations.

- Flow
  - Cycles for chapters/sections will happen in a span of two weeks. During that two weeks, team members are expected to read the identified section of the book and participate in discussion throughout both weeks.
  - This is intended to flow naturally. This means a small piece of advice or insight can be given at any point in time throughout the cycle. Participation can be given all at once or in multiple chunks - whatever flow works better for the individual to gain the most from the experience.
