## **Lance Feedback**
- I agree that there should be a path for pepple to join as data analysts and progress into data scientists, but I think this ignores a large number of students coming out with degrees in Data Science. We will not be competitive or even on the radar for this talent pool if we expect everyone to come in as a Data Analyst. 
  -  I propose a different maturity path for these resources. One where they come in with their technical skills as P1/P2 Data Scientists and there is an "option" to develop their business acumen. 
- I don't think that the DS needs to be in IT. That role can exist anywhere in the enterprise as long as we have a strategy for utilization and work prioritization. Moving the DS away from the business will hurt their effectiveness. 
- This looks like they are trying to match how things are done today and are ignoring the current talent market as well as how they would like things to be done in the future.
