# Quality Analytics Onboarding

## 🧐 What is this document?

Documenting organization process, culture, and solutions for all functions/departments in one company-wide handbook creates a Single Source of Truth (SSOT). Everyone should be empowered to contribute proposals to the handbook.

For many companies, the frenetic pace of business creates a false sense of justification for bypassing documentation. Once this happens, the only way to consistently learn is to ask another person, over and over. At scale, this is an extraordinarily wasteful process that leads to exhaustion, watered-down instructions, and huge knowledge gaps as team members cycle in and out.

Apply the spirit of iteration to documentation.

We want to encourage non-linear workdays where team members gain more control of their time and have more time for things like deep work.

## Purpose

❤️‍🔥 Get teams passionate about data!

When teams are passionate about data, they engage with it more and **take action**. They read reports and analyses. They ask **better questions**. They involve you when making **data-driven decisions**.

This simple but clear purpose leads to the question — “how do we get people passionate about our work?”. This is a fundamental question that can be asked with every piece of work we do. How do we create that feeling which piques someone’s curiosity and interest? This simple question allows us to think about the output of our work and how we deliver it and maximise our opportunity to make an impact.

## Mission

**Provide** in-depth analysis that puts data and insights at the heart of decision making

**Enable** self-serve analytics capabilities that empower teams to gain insights faster

**Support** in developing and tracking relevant measures/metrics

## Who we serve

## Why we are different (unique differentiators)

**Flexible work** means that we aren’t all in the office at the same time anymore, so it’s more important than ever that we be explicit about HOW we work together.

- What do we currently do here that we like?
- What do we want to be doing that could help us work more effectively together?

When something isn’t working for you, please escalate that to the broader team so we can revisit the norms to update or adjust them. We want to reconsider this document and our processes regularly to ensure that it actually supports our work, instead of getting in the way of it.

## How we hire

We don't hire based on culture or select candidates because we'd like to have a drink with them. We hire and reward team members based on our shared values as detailed on this page. We want a **values fit**, not a culture fit. We want cultural diversity instead of cultural conformity, such as a brogrammer atmosphere. Said differently: **"culture add" > "culture fit."**

## Policies

The intent of operating norms is to help us stay aligned while still maintaining flexibility for individuals.

- You don't need to ask for permission if you want to leave early for an appointment or take an hour off in the middle of the day; you can just do it

Most importantly, these policies are not set in stone, and we often find ourselves experimenting and iteratin with them as we settle into a working cadence.

## How we communicate

**Documentation** first! Write down and record knowledge over verbal explanations. This saves time in the future. An organization that does not put concerted effort into structured documentation has no choice but to watch its team members ask and re-ask for the same bits of data in perpetuity, creating a torturous loop of interruptions, meetings, and suboptimal knowledge transfers. In Quality Analytics, documentation is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). If you document information as you learn new things it removes the company wide burden of having to develop this answer from scratch again.

Documentation is an essential competitive advantage. Companies which rely on vocalizing end up repeating themselves over and over in meetings, creating an inefficient environment with tremendous opportunity for knowledge leaks. While communicating and documenting through text may feel like a burden in the moment, it prevents a toxic cycle of meetings and touch points which serve only to "bring people up to speed."

We have a bias towards [asynchronous communication](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/) and [nonlinear workdays](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/non-linear-workday/) to be as effective as possible.

### Devote time to fostering relationships

Not only do we get to know our coworkers better by seeing them in real time during video calls, we also get to know their pets and families too. This visual engagement helps us relate to each other on a more personal level, so when we meet in person, we already know each other.

### Meetings

- One is virtual, all are virtual in a meeting to ensure that everyone is participating on an equal playing field
- We commit to creating agendas at least 24 hours in advance for all live meetings
- Notes from meetings are always documented and shared back to the team
- More than two of us invited to another internal team's meeting? Others should feel free to decline

## Stand-ups for Distributed Teams

Our **daily stand-up** meeting is for bonding, blockers, and the future. Don't talk about what you did yesterday - this is not a report out where everyone tries to look busy. Instead, kickstart the day with some bonding, solve anything blocking us, and share future plans so people can plan, act, and ultimately save time.

Within Quality Analytics, we have team members across the United States: in one of our offices in Kansas or working remotely. We rely on stand-ups to keep everyone connected across geographies. Our heuristic for remote teams is simple: If one team member is remote, treat every team member as remote.

Our tip for distributed teams is to have every team member join a video stand-up on their own computer. With everyone in their own dedicated space and on the same video call, the team has leveled the playing field. All team members can see, hear, and experience the same information at the same time.

Imagine a team of eight people, with five co-located team members in a conference room and and three remote team members on a video call. This presents a challenge for remote team members wanting to pick up on the side conversations, body language, and gestures that don’t always translate through video. Not to mention the challenge of interjecting in a big group. With all eight team members on their own machines, no one will be missing out on important team dynamics.

## Agile

We lean towards [agile](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) without going full kool aid. Agile is an iterative approach to project management that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Agile is also called "iterative" project management. Instead of breaking your project down into phases that have to happen sequentially, you split your project up into smaller projects and ship each one as a step toward reaching the full goal. You'll plan the broad ideas of the project and divide it up, then plan, design, build, and test each part of the project individually. That lets you ship faster, and makes it easier to adapt the project along the way.

Six tips to build an agile mindset 👇

### ✅   **1.  Show respect for all team members**

Healthy, high-performing teams create a culture of trust and mutual respect. That's the backbone of agility.

Having an agile mindset means you embrace different ways of thinking and working, even if you don't always agree with them. Focus on keeping an open mind and seeking to understand new and unexpected ideas.

### ✅   **2.  Communicate openly and clearly**

Share updates. Ask questions. Be open and transparent at all times. With each interaction, challenge yourself to communicate clearly and concisely.

Encourage your team to engage in frequent discussions. Quality discussions can reveal critical information that moves the work forward and helps the team feel more connected.

### ✅  **3.  Look for ways to innovate**

Agility is all about delivering maximum value to customers. When a customer's needs change, you need to respond quickly with an innovative solution.

Having an agile mindset means you're constantly looking for opportunities to innovate. This could mean improving your team's internal processes. Or enhancing features of the product you're building.

As you complete your daily tasks, think if there are ways to improve what you're doing. Analyzing and improving your team's work will be valuable for your future career.

### ✅   **4.  Actively improve your skills**

Agile is all about continuous improvement. In your daily work, always look for opportunities to learn and grow your skillset.

Pause for a minute and think about your current skills: Which skills seem to be most valuable? Which skills mesh well with your natural tendencies? Use these questions as a starting point to help you plan which skills to sharpen.

Prioritizing your skill development is always a good idea. Not only does it help your team, but it also improves your future career opportunities.

### ✅   **5.  Your work doesn't have to be perfect**

Your goal is to deliver something that works; an MVP. Not to make every detail perfect.

Shift your mindset to focus on doing "good enough" work, and then get immediate feedback to improve the next version. Try to adopt this approach for both large and small tasks.

"Good enough" is different for every team and every project. If the parameters are not clear, you may want to discuss them with your team leader.

### ✅   **6.  Have a plan, but always be ready to pivot**

An agile mindset is about being flexible and ready for any unpredictable change. Yes, you should always have a Plan A (and B and C, if time allows). But you'll be most successful at work if your mind is always prepared to pivot.

## Kanban

Kanban is a popular agile framework that requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

The Kanban approach is a means of visualizing a project's status and progress via Kanban boards. (The Japanese word "kanban" means "billboard.") A Kanban board is divided into columns representing different stages of completion, like "not started," "in progress," and "complete." Tasks are sorted into columns and tagged with information, like priority level, person working on it, and project status.

A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).

Your Kanban system can be as flexible as you want—it's really just a way to visualize the Agile idea—but there are four pillars of the Kanban philosophy that can help make sure your projects get shipped. These include:

- **Cards:** Each task has a card that includes all relevant info about it; this makes sure everything needed to complete the tasks is always at hand.

- **Work in progress limits:** Limit how many cards are in play at once; this prevents teams from over-committing.

- **Continuous flow:** Move down the list of backlogs in order of importance, and make sure something's always being worked on.

- **Constant improvement (otherwise known as "kaizen"):** Analyze the flow to determine how efficiently you're working, and always strive to improve it.

## Technical onboarding

Give new hires access to the tools they'll be using in their role and encourage them to use the tools as early as possible. Using tools, even for small tasks, build confidence and helps new employees to feel productive and empowered.

You learn by looking up how to do a task, and then adding it to your toolbox.

Don't know how to do something? Do a Google search to look it up. When you’ve run out of things you have to look up, you will have mastered the task you set out to learn. Looking stuff up is how developers develop.

Seriously, you don’t need a course. Simply challenge yourself to look at as many new data formats as you can in Python or R (they’re both good), and, along the way, keep asking the internet how to overcome any hurdles that come up. After you open the data (here’s how to find data to look at: <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/>), come up with a question that strikes your fancy and try to use the tool to get an answer. Start small and get more ambitious as you go along. There’s nothing stopping you! Have fun!
