# Analytics Book Club Guidelines

The intent of the Analytics Book Club is to provide a collaborative space to learn new analytic, modeling, theory, buisness principles, and best practices to aid in employee's growth and training.

- Environment
  - This is an asynchronous book club. Most of the group's discussions will be posted/documented in a thread in the Quality Analytics Team.
  - Being Asychronous means that we will communicate concepts in a variety of ways whenever convenient. This means when you have an idea in your head, you can post it right away! Or have some food for thought for the team on a topic you read today? add it to the chat for poeple to think about.

- General Rules
  - Being a book club, there has to be some ground rules so expectations are set and everyone understands the principles of fostering and growing an inclusive environemnt
   - The aim is to have productive conversations about topics that can increase our productivety, ease some common blockers, or even just make our day easier. With this said, the goal is not to win arguments. The goal is to gain perspective and grasp what is the best for the team.
   - As awesome as it is to particpiate and voice your opinion and persepctive, please remeber to value other people's voices and take the time to read and consider their thoughts.
   - Be respectful and approach converstions with humulity
   - Use this reading and discussion time to brush up on good habits like note taking and enganing in intentional conversations
    
- Flow
  - Cycles for chapters/sections will happen in a span of two weeks. In that two weeks analysts are expected to read the next section of the book and participate in discussion throughout the weeks.
  - This is intended to flow naturally. This means a small piece of advice or insight can be given at any point in time throughout the cycle. participation can be given all at once or in multiple chunks. Whatever flow works better for the indivual to gain the most from the experience.
